This is some basic python code that I have started working on to manage the turbot cluster that I am working on.

At the inception of this project TurbotHQ had not yet released a Python API I have gone ahead and created an initial one so I did not have to constantly write REST commands into my scripts.

Currently this is being written in Python3.6 so please make sure you are using that.
